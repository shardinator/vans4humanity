          <p class="paragraph">Vans4Humanity provides a potential solution to homelessness. <br><br>Our goal is to make homelessness impossible within 10 years. We are creating a simple and cost effective van-based mobile home product that allows people to enjoy a relatively modern lifestyle at minimal cost, and with minimal fixed infrastructure requirements.<br>‍</p>
          <h1 class="heading-3">Why It Makes Sense</h1>
          <div class="rich-text-block w-richtext">
            <ul role="list">
              <li class="list-item">We provide housing and mobility in one go<br></li>
              <li>People can stay in low cost areas outside main urban centers but still have full mobility when required, e.g. for job interviews</li>
              <li>Solves an emergency need quickly and cost-effectively</li>
              <li>Very few infrastructure changes required<br></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <h1 class="heading-3">Stage One</h1>
          <p class="paragraph">Buy vans at market prices (ideally with some discounts), renovate them with local (in our case Australian) van refitters. <br><br>Sell them to charities and government agencies to distribute as they appropriate within their existing programs or with some modifications to existing programs.<br><br>Expected cost of a new residential van suitable for 1-2 people, AUD$125,000<br><br>The initial and main product is a small footprint van which fits in a regular car-parking space which includes:<br></p>
          <div>
            <div class="rich-text-block w-richtext">
              <ul role="list">
                <li class="list-item">Double bed</li>
                <li class="list-item">Small kitchen + fridge + single burner induction cooktop</li>
                <li class="list-item">Pull-out bathroom which includes wash basin, hot + cold recirculating shower (grey water is recycled), toilet (incinerator toilet which produces no sewage or dangerous waste)</li>
                <li>Small washer + dryer</li>
                <li>Easy access to overhead storage bins for food</li>
                <li>Seating area with movable table</li>
                <li>Storage area for personal belongings, located below the bed, accessible externally + internally</li>
                <li>Heating + cooling</li>
                <li>Solar power panels with sufficient battery storage<br></li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <h1 class="heading-3">Stage Two</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Mass produce vans at low cost. <br><br>Estimated cost of a new residential van AUD$60,000. This involves buying lower cost vans, mass producing the components to fit out the vans and buying components in bulk. <br><br>Designs will be open source and any other organisations will be able to use our designs and specifications to build their own vans as a not-for-profit. We encourage others to start similar organisations globally and help them to do so with advice from our learnings. We will call these spin-off NGOs ‘Friends of Vans4Humanity’ and work with them to scale our model globally.<br></p>
            <h1 class="heading-3">Stage Three</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Invest in the design and development of technologies that go into the vans e.g. water filtration and garbage disposal.<br><br>Develop easy to assemble A-Frame systems that can allow vans to be parked densely for urban areas that may have limited land availability.<br><br>Expand into the development of larger van designs with pull out components to house families in need.<br><br>Develop innovative funding systems to allow vans to be bought without a deposit. <br><br>Loans that require no upfront payment, and if payments cannot be made payments are added to the total loan and the life of the loan is extended.<br><br>Develop mobile education, health, retail (+ other types of services people may want) using platforms such as vans and buses, so they are easily movable. <br><br>Focus on developing countries and emergency relief around the world, since homelessness in countries like Australia on the path to being solved for good.<br></p>
            <h1 class="heading-3">Why This is the Right Solution</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="rich-text-block w-richtext">
            <ul role="list">
              <li>It is entirely a production and distribution issue, there are no other requirements to solve e.g. regulation</li>
              <li>Little need for upgrading infrastructure - most water is recycled, just rubbish and water filters need disposal (no sewage due to use of incinerator toilets)</li>
              <li>People have the opportunity to be mobile, allowing them to seek work where it’s available as well as partake in low cost leisure activities such as visiting beaches and national parks, which also improves mental health.</li>
              <li>Due to the popularity of the ‘van life’ culture there is little stigma involved in living in a modern residential van</li>
              <li>If the homelessness problem is solved and the vehicles are no longer required, they can be used for leisure purposes</li>
              <li>Allows existing communities and support networks to stay together, making it a low risk solution for everyone</li>
